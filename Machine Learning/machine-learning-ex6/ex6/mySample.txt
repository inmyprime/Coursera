Change your University password

Dear Hong Xu,

Your password is about to expire.

The University's password policy requires that passwords are changed at least once every year.

Please change your password within the next 2 weeks.

How to change your password

You can change your password by going to the University Homepage, clicking on either the Student or Staff menu at the top page and selecting "Password change".

Please ensure that you also change any passwords on your mobile devices (i.e. email, Wi-Fi, VPN, etc.). It will be necessary to switch these devices off and on again to reset to the new password.

It is advised that you restart your computer immediately after the change to ensure your password changes work across all your services.

If you experience any problems accessing services please contact one of the teams below for assistance:
Students, applicants and alumni should contact our Student Support Team
Staff and contractors should contact the Staff Service Centre
It is advised that passwords are always changed before taking a long term absence to prevent them expiring while away.

NOTE: The University will never ask for your University of Auckland password, nor direct you to a password changing facility through asking you to click on a link. These are hallmarks of phishing emails, which should be ignored and deleted.
